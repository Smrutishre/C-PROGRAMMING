# C-PROGRAMMING
 C program to print "helloÂ iter" -When we will run this program, it will display hello iter! in the console. 
Create score prediction: in this code, first we declare variables: desired_grade, min_average, current_average, final_weight, target_score, then we give the user input for those variables; it uses scanf to read the user's input. and '&' operator is used to pass the address of min_average to scanf.then we determine the target score by using if else.It then calculates the score needed on the final exam and displays the output.
Create maxmin: The program asks the user to enter the number of elements for an integer array,it then dynamically allocates memory using malloc, and checks for successful allocation. It then takes the array elements as input, initializes the maximum and minimum values with the first element, and iterates through the array to find the max and min values. Finally, it outputs these values and frees the allocated memory .
